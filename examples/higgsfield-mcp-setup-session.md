## What kit-doctor sees after the cook

- Evidence: 4 (smoke + examples + CHANGELOG = 4 points)
- Install story: 4-5 (SETUP-PROMPT.md present)
- Trigger fidelity: 4-5 (frontmatter description has "use when" + quoted phrases)
- Clarity: 4-5 (depends on SKILL.md body, unchanged by cook)
- Differentiation: 3 (default until cross-checked against the kit index)

Lifts the skill from sub-Promising to Promising 4.0-4.4 verdict.
